# Dartzee
All rights reserved

Contains 3 modules:

 - Core: Helper code which is compatible with both Android and Desktop apps, e.g. logging methods
 - DesktopCore: Helper code which is desktop-specific, e.g. to do with Swing/dialogs, Base64 stuff...
 - Darts: All the code for the desktop Dartzee application, which is dependent on Core and DesktopCore.

# Setup

Work to build using a build tool (Gradle/Maven) is on the backlog, however in the meantime you'll have to manually configure dependencies in the IDE of your choice.
Head to the /Dependencies directory to find all the JARs currently required, along with IntelliJ screenshots which should help you to get started.

Full backlog can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/Plz8blWw/dartzee)
